## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Rust (`rustup`)
- [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
- Python 3 (for serving the frontend)

## ⚙️ Build & Run

### 1. Compile Rust to WASM

```bash
cd guessing_game     # Enter Rust project
wasm-pack build --target web
```

### 2. Serve Frontend Locally

```bash
cd ../frontend       # Go to frontend folder
cp -r ../guessing_game/pkg ./   # Copy generated WASM files
python3 -m http.server 8090     # Run on http://localhost:8090
```

> 📦 Open [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) in your browser to play!
